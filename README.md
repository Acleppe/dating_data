# Dating Data Analysis

As part of my helping teach the "_Data Science: Intro to Python_" course, I made a database of some of my dating history.  It was used to introduce new students to Pandas -- see the accompanying [Jupyter Notebook](/intro_to_pandas_jpw_lecture.ipynb) for the actual lecture -- and I then wondered about the importance of factors in my own personal affinity for dating certain people versus others.  So, I quickly built a model to do a little investigating.
